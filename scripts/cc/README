Required modules to 'pip install':

 - requests
 - pytidylib

For these scripts to work, you must create a ~/.ccapi configuration
file in the following format:

{
    "api_key": "constantContactApiKey",
    "bearer_auth": "constantContactBearerAuthentication",
    "imap_username": "imapUsername",
    "imap_password": "imapPassword",
    "imap_host": "mail.example.com"
}

The IMAP server must support IMAP over SSL.

The script will scan the INBOX on the specified IMAP account for new messages
from Constant Contact, which can then be correlated to campaigns within the
Constant Contact REST API.
